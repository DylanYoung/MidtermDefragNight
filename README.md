#Midterm Defrag Night
Welcome to the repo for the Midterm Degrag Night. Tonight we will have a set of three challenges that can be accomplished by anyone. Tonight is a night about learning and coding, if you have any questions feel free to ask. If you find any challenge too simple, try it in a new language or extend it even further!

Each challenge will have its own folder and respective README file. At the end of the night we can do a vote to see who gets the prizes. Good luck and have fun!
